<p>"God blesses proud people with a child's heart; here, it's not about
innocence and purity, but about always being concerned only with their
own likes and dislikes."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>August 11, 2023, 9:28 PM California time, I'm writing this article in
my apartment in Los Angeles. This piece will be more of a casual nature,
without much pre-planning; I'll basically write whatever comes to
mind.</p>
<p>Firstly, I want to say that I feel like I'm on the relatively correct
path in my life, at least I don't have too much confusion and fear about
the future. When I think back to two years ago during the 2021
application season, looking around, I found that everyone had a strong
passion for research, but compared to that, I had a strong preference
for engineering. So, I was basically unable to find my own path. Last
year, I participated in the Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation
Institute, got into a state of entrepreneurship, but found myself
hesitant and not doing what I loved. This year, during the first half, I
joined a startup project and led an initial project, feeling that I've
gained new experiences and realizing more of my shortcomings. But
overall, I'm continuing down the path of engineering, looking for an
engineering job, something I'm very excited about. So, I still value the
opportunity to find a job in the second half of the year, and I want to
use this opportunity to learn and improve.</p>
<p>But overall, I think I've stumbled into quite a few pitfalls over
these three years and gained a lot of lessons.</p>
<p>I think the first major pitfall is "impatience". When I was in my
junior year, considering what kind of research I should do, I was too
impatient. I was eager to find a direction that had both research value
and market potential, and also matched my past experiences. In the end,
I spread myself too thin, unable to meet the demands of both technology
and the market. Now looking back, that was quite unrealistic. I've
talked to other master's and PhD students, and I've realized that
people's directions also change, not to mention the new directions and
demands that have arisen with the release of ChatGPT. "A
one-size-fits-all" approach is fundamentally impossible; I should focus
on gaining experiential knowledge from a technological standpoint,
rather than blindly investing in a fixed direction. Personally, I think
when you're young, you can experiment more and not rush to determine
your path (though this is also a pitfall in its own right).</p>
<p>The second major pitfall is "lack of confidence". This was especially
prominent during my junior and senior years, and has improved somewhat
since coming to the United States. My lack of confidence has always come
from my uncertain positioning and placing too much weight on many
things, thinking too far ahead. For example, I used to think that doing
a master's meant working hard on research or just getting a degree. But
I've come to understand that some people can go to a better place for a
platform's sake, which could also have been one of my choices. For me
now, even though I don't particularly like my current project, I'm more
inclined to accept it and make the right choices on top of it. From
another perspective, I don't have much time to hesitate anymore. My
previous lack of confidence came from always comparing my weaknesses to
others' strengths, and wanting to compare myself to everyone, which put
a lot of pressure on me. But now, I think I have strengths and
weaknesses, and I'm not set in stone. So, focusing on studying and
accumulating knowledge that suits me is the right choice. There's a
saying, "accumulate steadily and reap abundantly," and I think that's
very valuable.</p>
<p>The third major pitfall is "blindness and lack of information". To be
honest, this description of me is a bit exaggerated, as I've always
thought of myself as being good at socializing. It's just that looking
back, I do have that feeling sometimes. For instance, questions about
pursuing a Ph.D., entrepreneurship, or staying in the U.S., these are
all things that could have been judged by discussing more with others. I
think my abilities are relatively sufficient, but I lacked information
during that time, which caused a lot of internal struggle. Therefore, if
there's something I need to change first, it's that I hope to
communicate more with others, get more information, ensure I don't miss
opportunities, and also reduce my inner turmoil. From another
perspective, I've always thought that "what to do" is important, and I
still believe that. But at the same time, I've also realized that my
skills are still lacking, so "how to do it" is also very much worth
learning.</p>
<p>Overall, it's about slowing down the pace of life and increasing
satisfaction.</p>
<p>Another thing worth mentioning is that over these three years, I've
actually done a lot of exploration, even though sometimes I feel like I
haven't put in my full effort, I've still taken things seriously and
gained a lot. In 2021, I served as the head of the AI group and the head
of the administrative department, entering a crazy 4-month period of
overtime. I really felt busy and tired back then, but I learned about
team management, administrative handling, and other things. In 2022, I
participated in the autonomous driving and intelligent office chair
projects, the first time I approached projects with an entrepreneurial
mindset, realizing market thinking and design thinking. In 2023, I led a
team of old classmates to build a paper analysis project called ZipPaper
based on ChatGPT, and it was successfully launched. In this process, I
learned about project progress management, user research, and more.
Unfortunately, these three projects couldn't be sustained due to various
reasons. I think it's very much related to my personal state, as each
time it came to the time when I needed to advance my studies or find a
job, I just couldn't continue.</p>
<p>The period from February to August each year is a period of ups and
downs. To be honest, I'm not very satisfied. But I can accept it, after
all, I don't currently have the courage and ability to fully engage in
entrepreneurship. I hope I can persevere more, accumulate more.</p>
<p>About the future, it's flat, perhaps it's the years and experiences
that have smoothed out my edges. I hope I can slow down first, become a
mature member of society, and then start the next possible venture or
endeavor. I believe life is about regression to the mean; I can always
live the life I want.</p>
<p>Let's go!</p>
